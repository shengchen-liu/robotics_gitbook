Passing\nServices\nCompute Graph\nROS Terminology\n\n\n\n\nROS Essentials\nROS Summary\n\nOpen source\nHardware abstraction of device drivers\nCommunication via message passing\nSlick build and package management\nTools for visualization, simulation, analysis\nPowerful software libraries\n\nNodes and Topics\n3 high level steps:\n\nPerception\nDecision Making\nActuation\n\nROS breaks down the three major steps into separate nodes, for example:\n\nParameter server (Master)\nActs as a central repository where nodes on a system can look up parameter values.\nTopics\nNodes pass messages to one another via topics, which you can think of as a pipe connecting two nodes. Nodes can share data with one another by passing messages over topics.\nTo send a message, a node publish to that topic.\nTo receive a message, a node subscribes to a topic.\nMessage Passing\nOver pre-defined 200 message types + user-defined types\nFor example:\nPhysical Quantities: positions, velocities, rotations.\nSensor Readings: laser scan, images, point clouds\nServices\nRequest-Response type\nLike topics, services allow the passing of messages between nodes.  However, services have no publishers or subscribers. Instead, nodes interact with each other one-by-one by using request and response messages.\nCompute Graph\nAn RQT graph\nROS Terminology\n\n\n\n\nType\nFeatures\nDirection\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nAsynchronous\nUnidirectional\nUsed when exchanging data continuously\n\n\nService\nSynchronous\nBi-directional\nUsed when request processing requests and responds current states\n\n\nAction\nAsynchronous\nBi-directional\nUsed when it is difficult to use the service due to long response times after the request or when an intermediate feedback value is needed.\n\n\n\nROS\n ROS provides standard operating system services such as hardware  abstraction, device drivers,implementation of commonly used features  including sensing, recognizing, mapping, motion planning, message  passing between processes, package management, visualizers and libraries for development as well as debugging tools.\nMaster\n The master 2 acts as a name server for node-to-node connections and  message communication. The command roscore is used to run the master,  and if you run the master, you can register the name of each node and  get information when needed. The connection between nodes and message  communication such as topics and services are impossible without the  master.\nNode\n A node 4 refers to the smallest unit of processor running in ROS. Think  of it as one executable program. ROS recommends creating one single node for each purpose, and it is recommended to develop for easy  reusability. For example, in case of mobile robots, the program to  operate the robot is broken down into specialized functions. Specialized node is used for each function such as sensor drive, sensor data  conversion, obstacle recognition, motor drive, encoder input, and navigation.\nPackage\n A package 6 is the basic unit of ROS. The ROS application is developed  on a package basis, and the package contains either a configuration file to launch other packages or nodes. \n\n**Metapackage**\n A metapackage 7 is a set of packages that have a common purpose. For  example, the Navigation metapackage consists of 10 packages including  AMCL, DWA, EKF, and map_server.\nMessage\n A node 8 sends or receives data between nodes via a message. Messages  are variables such as integer, floating point, and boolean. Nested  message structure that contains another messages or an array of messages can be used in the message.\nTopic\n The topic 9 is literally like a topic in a conversation. The publisher  node first registers its topic with the master and then starts  publishing messages on a topic. Subscriber nodes that want to receive  the topic request information of the publisher node corresponding to the name of the topic registered in the master.\nPublish and Publisher\n The term ‘publish’ stands for the action of transmitting  relative messages corresponding to the topic. The publisher node  registers its own information and topic with the master, and sends a  message to connected subscriber nodes that are interested in the same  topic. The publisher is declared in the node and can be declared  multiple times in one node.\nSubscribe and Subscriber\n The term ‘subscribe’ stands for the action of receiving relative messages corresponding to the topic. The subscriber node registers its  own information and topic with the master, and receives publisher  information that publishes relative topic from the master. Based on  received publisher information, the subscriber node directly requests  connection to the publisher node and receives messages from the  connected publisher node. A subscriber is declared in the node and can  be declared multiple times in one node\nService\n The service 10 is synchronous bidirectional communication  between the service client that requests a service regarding a  particular task and the service server that is responsible for  responding to requests.\nService Server\n The ‘service server’ is a server in the service message  communication that receives a request as an input and transmits a  response as an output. Both request and response are in the form of  messages. Upon the service request, the server performs the designated  service and delivers the result to the service client as a response. The service server is implemented in the node that receives and executes a  given request.\nService Client\n The ‘service client’ is a client in the service message  communication that requests service to the server and receives a  response as an input. Both request and response are in the form of  message. The client sends a request to the service server and receives  the response. The service client is implemented in the node which  requests specified command and receives results.\nAction\n The action 11 is another message communication method used for  an asynchronous bidirectional communication. Action is used where it  takes longer time to respond after receiving a request and intermediate  responses are required until the result is returned. The structure of  action file is also similar to that of service. However, feedback data  section for intermediate response is added along with goal and result  data section which are represented as request and response in service  respectively. There are action client that sets the goal of the action  and action server that performs the action specified by the goal and  returns feedback and result to the action client.\nAction Server\n The ‘action server’ is in charge of receiving goal from the client and  responding with feedback and result. Once the server receives goal from  the client, it performs predefined process.\nAction Client\n The ‘action client’ is in charge of transmitting the goal to the server and receives result or feedback data as inputs from the action  server. The client delivers the goal to the action server, then receives corresponding result or feedback, and transmits follow up instructions  or cancel instruction.\nParameter\n The parameter 12 in ROS refers to parameters used in the node.  Think of it as *.ini configuration files in Windows program. Default  values are set in the parameter and can be read or written if necessary. In particular, it is very useful when configured values can be modified in real-time. For example, you can specify settings such as USB port  number, camera calibration parameters, maximum and minimum values of the motor speed.\nParameter Server\n When parameters are called in the package, they are registered with the parameter server which is loaded in the master.\nCatkin\n The catkin 14 refers to the build system of ROS. The build  system basically uses CMake (Cross Platform Make), and the build  environment is described in the ‘CMakeLists.txt’ file in the\n package folder. CMake was modified in ROS to create a ROS-specific\n build system.\nROS Build\n The ROS build (rosbuild) 15 is the build system that was used  before the Catkin build system. Although there are some users who still  use it, this is reserved for compatibility of ROS, therefore, it is  officially not recommended to use. If an old package that only supports  the rosbuild must be used, we recommend using it after converting  rosbuild to catkin.\nroscore \n roscore 16 is the command that runs the ROS master. If multiple  computers are within the same network, it can be run from another  computer in the network. However, except for special case that supports  multiple roscore, only one roscore should be running in the network.  When ROS master is running, the URI address and port number assigned for ROS_MASTER_URI environment variables are used. If the user has not set  the environment variable, the current local IP address is used as the  URI address and port number 11311 is used which is a default port number for the master.\nrosrun\n rosrun 17 is the basic execution command of ROS. It is used to run a  single node in the package. The node uses the ROS_HOSTNAME environment  variable stored in the computer on which the node is running as the URI  address, and the port is set to an arbitrary unique value.\nroslaunch\n While rosrun is a command to execute a single node, roslaunch 18 in\n contrast executes multiple nodes. It is a ROS command specialized in  node execution with additional functions such as changing package  parameters or node names, configuring namespace of nodes, setting  ROS_ROOT and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, and changing environment variables 19  when executing nodes. roslaunch uses the ‘*.launch’ file to define which nodes to be executed. The file is based on XML (Extensible Markup  Language) and offers a variety of options in the form of XML tags.\nbag\n The data from the ROS messages can be recorded. The file format  used is called bag 20 , and ‘*.bag’ is used as the file extension. In  ROS, bag can be used to record messages and play them back when  necessary to reproduce the environment when messages are recorded. For  example, when performing a robot experiment using a sensor, sensor  values are stored in the message form using the bag. This recorded  message can be repeatedly loaded without performing the same test by  playing the saved bag file. Record and play functions of rosbag are  especially useful when developing an algorithm with frequent program  modifications.\nROS Wiki\n ROS Wiki is a basic description of ROS based on Wiki  (http://wiki.ros.org/) that explains each package and the features  provided by ROS. This Wiki page describes the basic usage of ROS, a  brief description of each package, parameters used, author, license,  homepage, repository, and tutorial. The ROS Wiki currently has more than 18,800 pages of content.\nRepository\nAn open package specifies repository in the Wiki page. The  repository is a URL address on the web where the package is saved. The  repository manages issues, development, downloads, and other features  using version control systems such as svn, hg, and git. Many of  currently available ROS packages are using GitHub 21 as repositories for source code. In order to view the contents of the source code for each  package, check the corresponding repository.\nGraph\n The relationship between nodes, topics, publishers, and  subscribers introduced above can be visualized as a graph. The graphical representation of message communication does not include the service as it only happens one time. The graph can be displayed by running the  ‘rqt_graph’ node in the ‘rqt_graph’ package. There are two execution  commands, ‘rqt_graph’ and ‘rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph’.\nName\n Nodes, parameters, topics, and services all have names 22 .  These names are registered on the master and searched by the name to  transfer messages when using the parameters, topics, and services of  each node. Names are flexible because they can be changed when being  executed, and different names can be assigned when executing identical  nodes, parameters, topics, and services multiple times. Use of names  makes ROS suitable for large-scale projects and complex systems.\nClient Library\n ROS provides development environments for various languages by  using client library 23 in order to reduce the dependency on the  language used. The main client libraries are C++, Python, Lisp,and other languages such as Java, Lua, .NET, EusLisp, and R are also supported.  For this purpose, client libraries such as roscpp, rospy, roslisp,  rosjava, roslua, roscs, roseus, PhaROS, and rosR\n have been developed.\nURI\n A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a unique address that represents a resource on the Internet. The URI is one of basic components that  enables interaction with Internet and is used as an identifier in the  Internet protocol\nMD5\n MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) 24 is a 128-bit cryptographic hash  function. It is used primarily to verify data integrity, such as  checking whether programs or files are in its unmodified original form.  The integrity of the message transmission/reception in ROS is verified  with MD5.\nRPC\n RPC (Remote Procedure Call) 25 stands for the function that  calls a sub procedure on a remote computer from another computer in the  network. RPC uses protocols such as TCP/IP and IPX, and allows execution of functions or procedures without having the developer to write a  program for remote control\nXML\n XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a broad and versatile markup language that W3C recommends for creating other special purpose markup  languages. XML utilizes tags in order to describe the structure of data. In ROS, it is used in various components such as .launch, .urdf, and  package.xml.\nXMLRPC\n XMLRPC (XML-Remote Procedure Call) is a type of RPC protocol that uses  XML as the encoding format and uses the request and response method of  the HTTP protocol which does not maintain nor check the connection.  XMLRPC is a very simple protocol, used only to define small data types  or commands. As a result, XMLRPC is very lightweight and supports a  variety of programming languages, making it well suited for ROS, which  supports a variety of hardware and languages.\nTCP/IP\n TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is often called  TCP/IP. The Internet protocol layer guarantees data transmission using  TCP, which is based on the IP (Internet Protocol) layer in the Internet  Protocol Layers. It guarantees the sequential transmission and reception of data.TCPROS is a message format based on TCP/IP and UDPROS is a  message format based on UDP. TCPROS is more frequently used in ROS.\nCMakeLists.txt \n Catkin, which is the build system of ROS, uses CMake by default. The  build environment is specified in the ‘CMakeLists.txt’ 26 file in each  package folder.\npackage.xml\n An XML file 27 contains package information that describes the package name, author, license, and dependent packages. \n"},"ros/turtlesim.html":{"url":"ros/turtlesim.html","title":"Turtle Sim","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nTurtleSim\n\nSource the ROS environment\nRun TurtleSim\n\nStart the Master Process\nRun Turtlesim Nodes\nList All Active Nodes\nListing All Topics\nGet Information About a Specific Topic\n\nMessage Information\n\nEcho Messages on a Topic\n\n\n\n\n\nTurtleSim\nSource the ROS environment\nAdd the command into  ~/.bashrc file. \nsource /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash\n\nRun TurtleSim\nStart the Master Process\nBefore you can run any ROS nodes, you must start the Master process.\nThe Master process is responsible for the following (and more):\n\nProviding naming and registration services to other running nodes\nTracking all publishers and subscribers\nAggregating log messages generated by the nodes\nFacilitating connections between nodes\n\nTo run the master process, execute the command\nroscore\n\nRun Turtlesim Nodes\nFirst we will start the turtlesim_node, in the turtlesim package using the following command in a second terminal instance.\n$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node\n\nNext, we will start the turtle_teleop_key node, also from the turtlesim package in a third terminal instance.\n$ rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\n\nBy using the arrow keys with the turtle_teleop_key node’s console selected, we are able to move the turtle in turtlesim!\nList All Active Nodes\nrosnode list\n\nWe can see that there are three active nodes that have been registered with the ROS Master: /rosout, /teleop_turtle, and /turtlesim.\n\n/rosout: This node is launched by roscore.

Each package also contains a files with build instructions - the CMakeLists.txt file - and a package.xml file with information about the package.  Packages enable ROS users to organize useful functionality in a convenient and reusable format.\nCatkin Workspace\nA catkin workspace is a top-level directory where you build, install, and modify catkin packages.  The workspace contains all the packages for your project, along with several other directories for the catking system to use when building executables and other targets from your source code.\nCreate a Catkin Workspace\nStep 1: Create a catkin workspace and a sub directory\nAll of the ROS-related code you develop throughout this course will reside in your catkin workspace. You only need to create and initialize the workspace once.\nFirst, create the top level catkin workspace directory and a sub-directory named src (pronounced source). The top level directory name is arbitrary, but is often called catkin_ws (an abbreviation of catkin_workspace), so we will follow this convention. You can create these two directories in /home/workspace/ with a single command:\n$ mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src\n\nStep 2: Navigate to the source directory\nNext, navigate to the src directory with the cd command:\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src\n\nStep 3: Initialize the catkin workspace\nNow you can initialize the catkin workspace which will create a CMakeLists.txt file:\n$ catkin_init_workspace\n\n\nLet’s list the contents of the current directory to see what changed.\n$ ls -l\n\nNotice that a symbolic link (CMakeLists.txt) has been created to /opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake\nStep 4: Return to top level directory\nReturn to the catkin_ws,\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws\n\nStep 5: Build the Workspace\n$ catkin_make\n\nNote: you must issue this command from within the top level directory (i.e., within catkin_ws NOT catkin_ws/src)\nWhile it is not essential that you have a deep understanding of the catkin build system, particularly if you are doing most of your development work in Python, it is helpful to learn about it. We encourage you to read the ROS wiki.\nAfter the command is executed you will notice the output of the build processes being echoed to your display. When it has finished you should see the following lines at the end of the output:\n-- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is on\n-- Configuring done\n-- Generating done\n-- Build files have been written to: /home/workspace/catkin_ws/build\n#### Running command: \"make -j4 -l4\" in \"/home/workspace/catkin_ws/build\"\nBut what else has changed? Use the ls command again to see what is new.\n$ ls\n\n\nYou now have two new directories: build and devel. The aptly named build directory is the build space for C++ packages and, for the most part, you will not interact with it. The devel directory does contain something of interest, a file named setup.bash. This setup.bash script must be sourced before using the catkin workspace with source devel/setup.bash\nOptional\nBefore you begin to work with and develop your own ROS package, you can take a moment to get acquainted with catkin workspace conventional directory structure as described in the ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) 128 by clicking here.\n\nAdd a Package\n1. Cloning the simple_arm Package\nOne of the biggest benefits of using ROS is that it has a really large community of users and developers who have already created a lot of code that you can reuse.\nLet’s clone an existing package and add it to our newly created workspace.\nStart by navigating to the src directory and cloning the simple_arm package for this lesson from its GitHub repo.\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src/\n$ git clone -b first_interaction https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-simple_arm/simple_arm\n\n2. Building the simple_arm package\nAfter the repo has finished cloning, you can change directory to the top-level of the ROS workspace and build the new package.\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/\n$ catkin_make\n\nRosdep\nROS Package Dependencies\nROS packages have two types of dependencies: build dependencies and run dependencies.\nThe rosdep tool will check for a package's missing dependencies, download them, and install them.\nTo check for missing dependencies in a ROS package:\n$ rosdep check \n\nNote: In order for the command to work, the workspace must be first sourced with source devel/setup.bash.\nThis gives you a list of the system dependencies that are missing, and tells you where to get them.\nTo have rosdep install packages, invoke the following command from the root of the catkin workspace\n$ rosdep install -i \n\nsimple_arm Package Dependencies\nFortunately, the build and run dependencies for simple_arm package have been already installed in the workspace. You can double-check using rosdep check:\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/ \n$ source devel/setup.bash\n$ rosdep check simple_arm\n\nOutput: All system dependencies have been satisfied.\nCreate your own Packages\nYou'll begin your dive into ROS packages by creating one of your own. All ROS packages should reside under the src directory.\nAssuming you have already sourced your ROS environment and your catkin workspace, navigate to the src directory:\n$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src\n\nThe syntax for creating a catkin package is:\n$ catkin_create_pkg  [dependency1 dependency2 …]\n\nThe name of your package is arbitrary but you will run into trouble if you have multiple packages with the same name in your catkin workspace. Try to make it descriptive and unique without being excessively long. Let’s name ours “first_package” and we won’t specify any dependencies. By convention, package names are lowercase.\n$ catkin_create_pkg first_package\n\nVoilà. You just created your first catkin package! Navigating inside our newly created package reveals that it contains just two files: CMakeLists.txt and package.xml. This is a minimum working catkin package. It is not very interesting because it doesn't do anything, but it meets all the requirements for a catkin package. One of the main functions of these two files is to describe dependencies and how catkin should interact with them. We won’t pay much attention to them right now.\nI mentioned earlier that ROS packages have a conventional directory structure. Let’s take a look at a more typical package.\n\nscripts (python executables)\nsrc (C++ source files)\nmsg (for custom message definitions)\nsrv (for service message definitions)\ninclude -> headers/libraries that are needed as dependencies\nconfig -> configuration files\nlaunch -> provide a more automated way of starting nodes\n\nOther folders may include\n\nurdf (Universal Robot Description Files)\nmeshes (CAD files in .dae (Collada) or .stl (STereoLithography) format)\nworlds (XML like files that are used for Gazebo simulation environments)\n\n\nThere are many packages that you can install.

ROS Publishers\n2. Node - Simple Mover\n\nTopics\nBuild and Run\nModifying CMakeLists.txt\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite ROS Nodes\n1. ROS Publishers\nPublishers allow a node to send messages to a topic, so that data from the node can be used in other parts of ROS.  In C++, ROS publishers typically have the following definition format, although other parameters and arguments are possible:\nros::Publisher pub1 = n.advertise(\"/topic_name\", queue_size);\n\nThe pub1 object is a publisher object instantiated from the ros::Publisher class. This object allows you to publish messages by calling the publish() function.\nTo communicate with ROS master in C++, you need a NodeHandle. The node handle n will fully initialize the node.\nThe advertise() function is used to communicate with ROS and inform that you want to publish a message on a given topic name. The \"/topic_name\" indicates which topic the publisher will be publishing to.\nThe message_type is the type of message being published on \"/topic_name\". For example, the string message data type in ROS is std_msgs::String.\nThe queue_size indicates the number of messages that can be stored in a queue. A publisher can store messages in a queue until the messages can be sent. If the number of messages stored exceeds the size of the queue, the oldest messages are dropped.\nOnce the publisher object pub1 has been created, as above, a message with the specified data type can be published as follows:\npub1.publish(msg);\n\nFor more information about C++ ROS publishers, see the documentation here.\n2. Node - Simple Mover\nYou will now go through the process of implementing your first ROS node in C++. This node is called simple_mover. As its name implies, this node only has one responsibility, and that is to command joint movements for simple_arm.\nThe goal of the simple_mover node is to command each joint in the simple arm and make it swing between -pi/2 to pi/2 over time. \nTopics\nTo do so, it must publish joint angle command messages to the following topics:\n\n\n\nTopic Name\n/simple_arm/joint_1_position_controller/command\n\n\n\n\nMessage Type\nstd_msgs/Float64\n\n\nDescription\nCommands joint 1 to move counter-clockwise, units in radians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic Name\n/simple_arm/joint_2_position_controller/command\n\n\n\n\nMessage Type\nstd_msgs/Float64\n\n\nDescription\nCommands joint 2 to move counter-clockwise, units in radians\n\n\n\nBuild and Run\nBefore you can run the simple_mover node, you have to compile the C++ script.\nModifying CMakeLists.txt\nIn order for catkin to generate the C++ libraries, you must first modify simple_arm’s CMakeLists.txt.\nCMake is the build tool underlying catkin, and CMakeLists.txt is a CMake script used by catkin. If you’re familiar with the concept of makefiles, this is similar.\nNavigate to the package CMakeLists.txt file and open it:\n$ cd /home/shengchen/workspace/SimpleArm/catkin_ws/src/simple_arm/\n$ gedit CMakeLists.txt\n\nFirst, ensure that the find_package() macro lists std_msgs, message_generation, and controller_manager as required packages.

This procedure is very precise (in fact, the precision can be adjusted explicitly by changing how fine you choose to discretize the space) and very thorough, as its discretizes the complete workspace.  As a result, discrete planning can be very computationally expensive - possibly prohibitively so for large path planning problems.\nThe image below displays one possible implementation of discrete path planning applied to a 2-dimensional workspace.\n\nDiscrete path planning is elegant in its preciseness, but is best suited for low-dimensional problems. For high-dimensional problems, sample-based path planning is a more appropriate approach.\nSample-based path planning\nSample-based path planning probes the workspace to incrementally construct a graph.  In stead of  discretizing every segment of the workspace, sample-based planning takes a number of samples and uses them to build a discrete representation of the workspace.  The resultant graph is not as prcise as one created using discrete planning, but it is much quicker to construct because of the relatively small number of samples used.\nA path generated using sample-based planning may not be the best path, but in certain applications - it's better to generate a feasible path quickly than to wait hours or even days to generate the optimal path. \n\nProbabilist path planning\nWhile the first two approaches looked at the path planning problem generically - with no understanding of who or what may be executing the actions - probabilistic path planning takes into account the uncertainty of the robot’s motion.\nWhile this may not provide significant benefits in some environments, it is especially helpful in highly-constrained environment or environments with sensitive or high-risk areas.\n\n"},"path_planning/continuous_representation.html":{"url":"path_planning/continuous_representation.html","title":"Continuous Representation","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nContinuous Representation\n\nConfiguration Space (C-space)\nMinkowski Sum\nMinkowski Sum C++\n\nGenerated Configuration Space\nTranslation\nFinal Result\n\n3D Configuration Space\n\n\n\n\nContinuous Representation\nConfiguration Space (C-space)\nTo account for the geometry of a robot and simplify the task of path planning, obstacles in the workspace can be inflated to create a new space called the the configuration space (C-space). With the obstacles inflated by the radius of the robot, the robot can then be treated as a point, making it easier for an algorithm to search for a path.  The C-space is the set of all robot poses, and can be broken-down into C_{Free} and C_{Obs}.\n\nMinkowski Sum\nThe Minkowski sum is a mathematical property that can be used to compute the configuration space given an obstacle geometry and robot geometry.  The intuition behind the Minkowski sum is calculated can be understood by imagining to paint the outside of an obstacle using a paintbrush that is shaped like your robot, with the robot's origin as the tip of the paintbrush.  The painted area is C_{Obs}\n\nTo create the configuration space, the Minkowski sum is calculated in such a way for every obstacle in the workspace. The image below shows three configuration spaces created from a single workspace with three different sized robots. As you can see, if the robot is just a dot, then the obstacles in the workspace are only inflated by a small amount to create the C-space. As the size of the robot increases, the obstacles are inflated more and more.\n\nMinkowski Sum C++\nIn this example, you can see two triangles - a blue and a red one. Let's suppose the robot is represented by a blue triangle and the obstacle is represented by a red triangle. Your task is to compute the configuration space C of robot A and obstacle B in C++.\n\nRobot: Blue triangle denoted by A\n\nObstacle: Red triangle denoted by B\n\n\n\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Print 2D vectors coordinate values\nvoid print2DVector(vector > vec)\n{\n    // Sorting the vector for grading purpose\n    sort(vec.begin(), vec.end());\n    for (int i = 0; i  > delete_duplicate(vector > C)\n{\n    // Sort the C vector\n    sort(C.begin(), C.end());\n    // Initialize a non duplicated vector\n    vector > Cn;\n    for (int i = 0; i  > minkowski_sum(vector > A, vector > B)\n{\n    vector > C;\n    for (int i = 0; i  Ci = { A[i][0] + B[j][0], A[i][1] + B[j][1] };\n            // Push it to the C vector\n            C.push_back(Ci);\n        }\n    }\n    C = delete_duplicate(C);\n    return C;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Define the coordinates of triangle A and B using 2D vectors\n    vector > A(3, vector(2));\n    vector > B(3, vector(2));\n\n    // Compute the minkowski sum of triangle A and B\n    vector > C;\n    C = minkowski_sum(A, B);\n\n    // Print the resulting vector\n    print2DVector(C);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nGenerated Configuration Space\n\nTranslation\nYou successfully coded the Minkowski sum in C++ and generated the configuration space. You can easily notice that the red obstacle is not well inflated and the blue robot can still hit the obstacle. That's because the configuration space still has to be shifted to the obstacle.\nInitially, the robot should be translated to the obstacle, and then after computing the configuration space, it should be translated to both the robot and obstacle.\nFinal Result\n\n3D Configuration Space\nAs you saw, the configuration space for a robot changes depending on its rotation. Allowing a robot to rotate adds a degree of freedom - so, sensibly, it complicates the configuration space as well. Luckily, this is actually very simple to handle. The dimension of the configuration space is equal to the number of degrees of freedom that the robot has.\nWhile a 2D configuration space was able to represent the x- and y-translation of the robot, a third dimension is required to represent the rotation of the robot.\nLet’s look at a robot and its corresponding configuration space for two different rotations. The first will have the robot at 0°, and the second at 18°.\n\n\nA three-dimensional configuration space can be generated by stacking two-dimensional configuration spaces as layers - as seen in the image below.\n\nIf we were to calculate the configuration spaces for infinitesimally small rotations of the robot, and stack them on top of each other - we would get something that looks like the image below.\n\n"},"path_planning/discrete planning.html":{"url":"path_planning/discrete planning.html","title":"Discretization","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nDiscrete Planning\n\n\n\nDiscrete Planning\nDiscrete planning looks to explicitly discretize the robot's workspace into a connected graph, and apply a graph-search algorithm to calculate the best path.

This is done with the help of a search algorithm.\nTwo roadmap methods will be disucussed:\n\nVisibility graph\nVoronoi Diagram\n\n"},"path_planning/visibility_graph.html":{"url":"path_planning/visibility_graph.html","title":"Visibility graph","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nVisibility Graph\n\n\n\nVisibility Graph\nThe Visibility Graph builds a roadmap by connecting the start node, all of the obstacle's vertices, and goal node to each other - except for those that would result in collisions with obstacles.  The Visibility Graph has its name for a reason - it connects every node to all other nodes that are \"visible\" from its location.\n\nNodes: Start, Goal, and all obstacle vertices.\nEdges: An edge between two nodes that does not intersect an obstacle, including obstacle edges.\n\nThe following image illustrates a visibility graph for a configuration space containing polygonal obstacles.\n\nThe motivation for building Visibility Graphs is that the shortest path from the start node to the goal node will be a piecewise linear path that bends only at the obstacles’ vertices. This makes sense intuitively - the path would want to hug the obstacles’ corners as tightly as possible, as not to add any additional length.\nOnce the Visibility Graph is built, a search algorithm can be applied to find the shortest path from Start to Goal. The image below displays the shortest path in this visibility graph.\n\nOne disadvantage to the Visibility Graph is that it leaves no clearance for error. A robot traversing the optimal path would have to pass incredibly close to obstacles, increasing the risk of collision significantly. In certain applications, such as animation or path planning for video games, this is acceptable. However the uncertainty of real-world robot localization makes this method impractical.\n"},"path_planning/voronoi.html":{"url":"path_planning/voronoi.html","title":"Voronoi Diagram","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nVoronoi Diagram\n\n\n\nVoronoi Diagram\nUnlike the visibility graph method which generates the shortest paths, Voronoi Diagrams maximize clearance between obstacles.\nA Voronoi Diagram is a graph whose edges bisect the free space in between obstacles.  Every edge lies equidistant from each obstacle around it - with the greatest amount of clearance possible.\nOnce a Voronoi Diagram is constructed for a workspace, it can be used for multiple queries.  Start and goal nodes can be connected into the graph by constructing the paths from the nodes to the edge closest to each of them.\nEvery edge will either be a straight line, if it lies between the edges of two obstacles, or it will be a quadratic, if it passes by the vertex of an obstacle.\n\n"},"path_planning/cell_decomposition.html":{"url":"path_planning/cell_decomposition.html","title":"Cell Decomposition","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nCell Decomposition\n\n\n\nCell Decomposition\nCell decomposition divides the space into discrete cells, where each cell is a node and adjacent cells are connected with edges.

This is commonly done by breaking up the space into triangles and trapezoids, which can be accomplished by adding vertical line segments at every obstacle's vertex.  \n\nOnce a space has been decomposed, the resultant graph can be used to search for the shortest path from start to goal. \n\nAdvantages\nExact cell decomposition is elegant because of its precision and completeness.  Every cell is either \"full, meaning it is completely occupied by an obstacle, or it is \"empty\", meaning it is free.  And the union of all cells exactly represents the configuration space.  If a path exists from start to goal, the resultant graph will contain it.\nTo implement exact cell decomposition, the algorithm must order all obstacle vertices along the x-axis, and then for every vertex determine wheterh a new cell must be created or whether two cells should be merge together.  Such an algorithm is called the Plane Sweep Algorithm.\nDisadvantages\nExact cell decomposition results in cells of awkward shapes.  Collections of uniquely-shaped trapezoids and triangles are more difficult to work with than a regular rectangular grid.  This results in an added computational complexity, especially for s with greater number of dimensions.  \nIt is also difficult to compute the decomposition when obstacles are note polygonal, but of an irregular shape.\n"},"path_planning/approximate_cell_decomposition.html":{"url":"path_planning/approximate_cell_decomposition.html","title":"Approximate Cell Decomposition","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nApproximate Cell Decomposition\n\nSimple Decomposition\nIterative Decomposition (QuadTree)\n\nAlgorithm\n\nOctrees\n\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximate Cell Decomposition\nApproximate cell decomposition divides a configuration space into discrete cells of simple, regular shapes -  such as rectangles and squares (or other multidimensional equivalents).  Aside from simplifying the computation of cells, this method also supports hierarchical decomposition of space.\nSimple Decomposition\nA 2-dimensional configuration space can be decomposed into a grid of rectangular cells.  Then, each cell could be marked or empty, as before.  A search algorithm can then look for a sequence of free cells to connect the start node to the final node.\nSuch a method is more efficient than exact cell decomposition, but it losses its completeness.  It is possible that a particular configuration space contains a feasible path, but the resolution of the cells results in some of the cells encompassing the path to be marked \"full\"  due to the presence of obstacles.  A cell will be marked \"full\" whether 99% of the space is occupied by an obstacle or a mere 1%.  Evidently, this is not practical.\nIterative Decomposition (QuadTree)\nAn alternate method of partitioning a space into simple cells exists.  Instead of immediately decomposing the space into small cells of equal size, the method recursively decomposes a space into four quadrants.  Each quadrant is marked full, empty, or a new label called 'mixed' - used to represent cells that are somewhat occupied by an obstacle, but also contain some free space.  If a sequence of free cells cannot be found from start to goal, then the mixed cells will be further decomposed into another four quadrants.  Through this process, more free cells will emerge, eventually revealing a path if one exists.\nThe 2-dimensional implementation of this method is called quadtree decomposition.\nAlgorithm\nDecompose the configuration space into four cells, label cells free, mixed or full.\nSearch for a sequecne of free cells that connect the start node to the goal node.\nIf such a sequence exists:\n    \\quadReturn path\nElse:\n    \\quadFurther decomposes the mixed cells\n\nOctrees\nThe 3-dimensional equivalent of quadtrees are octrees, depicted in the image below.  The method discretizing a space with any number of dimensions follows the same procedure as the algorithm described above, but expanded to accommodate the additional dimensions.\n\nAlthough exact cell decomposition is a more elegant method, it is much more computationally expensive than approximate cell decomposition for non-trivial environments. For this reason, approximate cell decomposition is commonly used in practice.\nAdvantage\nWith enough computation, approximate cell decomposition approaches completeness.  However it is not optimal = the resultant path depends on how cells are decomposed.  Approximate cell decomposition find the obvious solution quickly.  It is possible that the optimal path squeezes through a minuscule opening between obstacles, but the resultant path takes a much longer route through wide open spaces - one that the recursively-decomposing algorithms would find first.\nDisadvantage\nApproximate cell decomposition is functional, but like all discrete/combinatorial path planning methods - it starts to be computationally intractable for use with high-dimensional environments.\n"},"path_planning/potential_field.html":{"url":"path_planning/potential_field.html","title":"Potential Field","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nPotential Field\n\nAttractive Potential Field\nRepulsive Potential Field\nPotential Field Sum\nProblems with the Potential Field Method\n\n\n\n\nPotential Field\nUnlike the methods discussed thus far that discretize the continuous space into a connected graph, the potential field method performs a different type of discretizatioin.\nTo accomplish its task, the potential field method generates two functions:\n\nAttracts the robot to the goal\nRepels the robot away from obstacles.\n\nThe two functions can be summed up to create a discretized representation.  By applying an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent, a robot can move toward the goal configuration while steering around obstacles.  \nAttractive Potential Field\nThe attractive potential field is a function with the global minimum at the goal configuration.  If a robot is placed at any point and required to follow the direction of steepest descent, it will end up at the goal configuration.  This function does not need to be complicated, a simple quadratic function can achieve all the requirements.\nf_{att}(\\textbf{x}) = \\nu_{att}(||\\textbf{x}-\\textbf{x}_{goal}||)^2 where \\textbf{x} represents the goal position.   \\nu is a scaling factor.\n\nRepulsive Potential Field\nThe repulsive potential field is a function that is equal to zero in free space, and grows to a large value near obstacles.  One way to create such a potential field is with the function below.\n\nf _{rep} =\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\nu _{rep} (\\frac{1}{\\rho(\\textbf{x})}-\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}})^{2}\\ \\quad if\\ \\rho\\leq \\rho_{0},\\\\ \\\\ 0 \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad \\ if\\ \\rho > \\rho_{0}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right.\n\nWhere the function \\rho(\\textbf{x}) returns the distance from the robot to its nearest obstacle, \\rho_0 is a scaling parameter that defines the reach of an obstacle’s repulsiveness, and \\nu is a scaling parameter.\nAn image of a repulsive potential field for an arbitrary configuration space is provided below.\n\nPotential Field Sum\nThe attractive and repulsive functions are summed to produce the potential field that is used to guide the robot from anywhere in the space to the goal. The image below shows the summation of the functions, and the image immediately after displays the final function.\n\nImagine placing a marble onto the surface of the function - from anywhere in the field it will roll in the direction of the goal without colliding with any of the obstacles (as long as \\rho_0 is set appropriately)!\nThe gradient of the function dictates which direction the robot should move, and the speed can be set to be constant or scaled in relation to the distance between the robot and the goal.\nProblems with the Potential Field Method\nThe potential field method is not without its faults - the method is neither complete nor optimal. In certain environments, the method will lead the robot to a local minimum, as opposed to the global minimum.\nThe problem of a robot becoming stuck in a local minimum can be resolved by adding random walks, and other strategies that are commonly applied to gradient descent, but ultimately the method is not complete.\nThe potential field method isn’t optimal either, as it may not always find the shortest (or cheapest) path from start to goal. The shortest path may not follow the path of steepest descent. In addition, potential field does not take into consideration the cost of every step.\n"},"path_planning/graph_search.html":{"url":"path_planning/graph_search.html","title":"Graph Search","keywords":"","body":"TreeviewCopyright © aleen42 all right reserved, powered by aleen42\nGraph Search\n\nUninformed Vs Informed Search\nTerminology\n\n\n\n\nGraph Search\nUninformed Vs Informed Search\nUninformed search algorithms are not provided with any information about the whereabouts of the goal, and thus search blindly.
